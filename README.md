# Predicting the response to flu vaccine

In this project, we use a dataset of ~1300 observations about 700 patients and aim to predict the response of the patients to the vaccine. We describe the response in several ways which all depend on the seroconversion measured after 3-4 weeks of vaccination. Seroconversion
The dataset consists of several factors that could potentialy help us in predicting the immune reponse of a given patient to the flu shot. 

It is important to be able to predict this because when a vaccine is administered into a body, there is no guarantee that it will lead to the development of antibodies. And even if it does, there is no guarantee that there will be a development of substantial antibodies. Different bodies respond differently to the vaccine which can be due to several reasons.
