# Predicting the response to flu vaccine

Predicting the immune response of a vaccine in patients is a very as it is associated with predicting the efficacy of the vaccine. It is important to be able to predict this because when a vaccine is administered into a body, there is no guarantee that it will lead to the development of antibodies. And even if it does, there is no guarantee that there will be a development of substantial antibodies. This is because different bodies respond differently to the vaccine, and this can be due to several reasons. And hence, we use the dataset published in this paper: , to be able to predict the response of a body to the flu vaccine. 


The dataset consists of ~1300 observations about 700 patients that took the flu vaccine in the given season. It consists of several demographic factors about the patients, their age, health, comorbidities, and the amount of antibodies already present in the body on the day of getting the flu shot. These antibodies are measured before the flu shot is administered. Our field of interest that helps us quantify the immune response to the vaccine is _seroconversion._

To understand seroconversion, let us first understand what does a vaccine contain and what actually happens when a vaccine is administered into the body.

The flu vaccine contains dead/inactivated virus for 4 different strains of the influenza virus. Dead/inactivated virus containing vaccines in general provide immunity for a shorter period of time. Once administered into the body, the immune system generates antibodies that can fight this same virus if and when it infects the body again.
