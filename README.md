# Predicting the response to flu vaccine

In this project, we are given a dataset of ~1300 observations about 700 patients. The dataset consists of several factors that coudl otentialy help us in predicting the immune reponse of a given patient to the flu shot. 

Before diving in, let us first understand why is it important to be able to predict this. When a vaccine is administered into a body, there is no guarantee that it will lead to the development of antibodies. And even if it does, there is no guarantee that there will be a development of substantial antibodies. Different bodies respond differently which is attributed to plenty of reasons.
