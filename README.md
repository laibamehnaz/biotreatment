# Predicting the response to flu vaccine

Predicting the immune response of a vaccine in patients is a very important task as it is associated with predicting the efficacy of the vaccine. It is important to be able to predict this because when a vaccine is administered into a body, there is no guarantee that it will lead to the development of antibodies. And even if it does, there is no guarantee that there will be a development of substantial antibodies. Different bodies respond differently to the vaccine which can be due to several reasons. And hence, being able to predict the 


In this project, we use a dataset of ~1300 observations about 700 patients and aim to predict their immune response to the vaccine. We measure the response of a patient by the amount of antibodies developed in the patient after 3-4 weeks of vaccination. 

To understand seroconversion, let us begin with the vaccine.

The flu vaccine contains antigens for 4 different strains of the influenza virus. Antigen is basically the dead virus that is injected into our bodies through the vaccine so that our immune system can learn how to fight it. In this process, our immune system generated antibodies that can fight this same virus if and when it infects the body again.

The dataset consists of several factors that could potentialy help us in predicting the immune reponse of a given patient to the flu shot.
